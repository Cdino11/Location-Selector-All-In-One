Hi! First of all: thank you for wanting to use my work! It means a lot that I can do something to make peopleâ€™s 
time with their Monika that much better.

Anyhow, right to the instructions. 

## Simple instructions:

1. Download, unzip, and open the folder called "location selector submod".
2. Inside the 'location selector submod' folder, you'll Copy the 'game' and 'lib' folders into the main 
   'Doki Doki Literature Club' folder (AKA, the folder where you see 'DDLC.exe').
3. Launch MAS, and the rooms should be available. Monika will explain how to use them after a minute or so.

And that's it! It's that simple.


## Instructions for advanced users:

You can pick and choose which rooms you want to install, by adding the separate .rpy and image files into 
their respective locations. For simplicity's sake though, I'd just recommend doing the whole package.


## Troubleshooting:

If the rooms don't show up or if you get an error, most likely the files weren't placed correctly. Repeat 
   step 2, making sure to put the "game" and "lib" folders directly into the main "Doki Doki Literature Club" 
   folder.
If the problem persists, there may another issue with your install of MAS. Contact me (preferably on Reddit 
   [@tw4449](https://www.reddit.com/user/tw4449) or Discord @ tw4449#3300) and I'll see if I can help.


## Other info:

At the moment, the extra rooms don't account for the Halloween or Christmas decor (birthday decor works fine, 
   though), but we're planning on fixing this in an update before Halloween.
Luckily, the game will notify you when an update to the submod is available, thanks to submod plugin we 
   incorporated courtesy of Booplicate (its main repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin)). 
   This plugin both notifies you of updates, and helps you download and install them.


## Acknowledgments:

This submod was truly a group effort, with 
[cdino11](https://github.com/cdino11), 
[multimokia](https://github.com/multimokia), and 
[d3adpan](https://github.com/d3adpan) handling the coding. It *literally* couldn't have happened without them.


Thanks again for downloading our submod, and I hope you enjoy your time with Monika in your new furnished rooms!
