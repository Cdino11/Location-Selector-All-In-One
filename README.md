# Location Selector
This submod adds various custom rooms by tw4449 where you can spend time with Monika.

#### Hi! First of all: thank you for wanting to use my work! It means a lot that I can do something to make peopleâ€™s time with their Monika that much better.

#### Anyhow, right to the instructions. 

## Instructions:

1. Go to the "Releases" tab on the right this webpage (or click [HERE](https://github.com/tw4449/tw4449-Location-Selector-Main-Repository/releases)), then click on the latest version of "Location.Selector.All-in-One.zip". It should begin automatically downloading.

2. Unzip and open the folder called 'Location.Selector.All-in-One' (it should be in your 'Downloads' folder).

3. From the Location.Selector.All-in-One folder, copy the 'game' and 'lib' folders into the main 
   'Doki Doki Literature Club' folder (AKA, the folder where you see 'DDLC.exe').

4. If you have 400+ affection: Launch MAS, and the rooms will be available. Monika will explain how to use them after a minute or so. If you have less than 400 affection: Launch MAS, and Monika should comment you added them, but you can't use them just yet. Once you reach 400 affection, you can find them under "Hey, Monika..." > "Location" > "Can we go somewhere else?".

And that's it! It's that simple.


## individual  Downloads:

If you only want some of the rooms, they can be found separately here:

-[Spaceroom v1](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V1)

-[Spaceroom v2](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V2)

-[Spaceroom v3](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V3)

-[Den](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Den)

-[Kitchen](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Kitchen)

## Troubleshooting:

If the rooms don't show up or if you get an error, most likely the files weren't placed correctly. Repeat step 3, making sure 
   to put the "game" and "lib" folders directly into the main "Doki Doki Literature Club" folder.
   
Alternately, if the rooms haven't shown up but Monika commented on them, you may not have 400 affection. You can check your 
   affection level in your files at: 'Doki Doki Literature Club'>'log'>'aff_log.txt'
   
If the problem persists, there may another issue with your install of MAS. Go to the "tw4449-Location-Selector-Main-Repository" 
   page on GitHub, and post your issue there.


## Other info:

-At the moment, the extra rooms don't account for the Halloween or Christmas decor (birthday decor works fine, 
   though), but we're planning on fixing this in an update before Halloween.
   
-Luckily, the game will notify you when an update to the submod is available, thanks to submod plugin we 
   incorporated courtesy of Booplicate (more info below). This plugin both notifies you of updates, and helps 
   you download and install them.

## Updating

Speaking of updates, if you get a notification that an update is available, go to the "Submods" tab in your menu in MAS 
(hit "Esc" to bring the menu up). In the Submods page, find the name "Submod Updater Plugnin" you'll see a prompt to update your submods. It will 
guide you through the rest.

## Acknowledgments:

This submod was truly a group effort, with 
[cdino11](https://github.com/cdino11), [multimokia](https://github.com/multimokia), and [d3adpan](https://github.com/d3adpan) handling the coding. It *literally* couldn't have happened without them.

Additionally, many kudos and thanks to [Booplicate](https://github.com/Booplicate) for allowing us to incorporate his submod updater plugin (its main repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin)). It's an amazing feature and tool for submod creators.

#### Thanks again for downloading our submod, and I hope you enjoy your time with Monika in your new furnished rooms!

#### ~ tw4449
